Descriptions follow:\r\n\r\n+ JA14300popmap, JA14785popmap and total_popmap: Barcodes sorted by individual, for each\r\nsequencing run separately, and both combined. For more information on why these barcode \r\nfiles are need it, please see [this](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037135)\r\npaper on ddRAD sequencing.\r\n\r\n+ Converter.py: short script using the [dendropy 3.x](https://pythonhosted.org/DendroPy/) \r\nlibrary to convert between file formats. Usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npython converter.py 'path to files' 'extension of files' 'format of input files' 'format you'd like exported'\r\n```\r\nExample\r\n```python \r\npython converter.py ./ .nex nexus DNAphylip\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Populations, cstacks, sstacks, ustacks, process_rad: Scripts for the [Stacks](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/)\r\npipeline\r\n\r\n+ relabel_str.py: Relabeling script, as Stacks outputs files with their numerical names, \r\nrather than their locality data. Would be smart to change this to take an input file of \r\nnames, rather than having them hardcoded, but I never got around to it.\r\n\r\n+ Rename.py: modification of script from Becca Tarvin to rename files output from process_rad,\r\nwhich are named for their barcodes. Could combine this and relabelstr.py to add in the \r\nlocality data earlier.\r\n\r\n+ Renexus.py: This is actually the same script as relabelstr.py. I should delete one of\r\nthem, but it feels ... dishonest?\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
